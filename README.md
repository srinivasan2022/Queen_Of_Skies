# Queen of the skies demo

This demo will allow you to leverage the elements of Fabric Real-Time Analytics to showcase a powerful demo with a compeling story.

|:---------------------------|
| **You can download the different files for the demo as stated in the steps below. To get everything in one single step just clone the FabricCAT repo to your local machine.**|

## Demo backstory

On February 1st, 2023, something very special happened in Everett, WA. Atlas Air, a well-known cargo plane operator, took delivery of a new airplane. Only this plane happens to be the last of the Boeing 747 that will ever be made.

## Prepare a text file for your important parameters

We will need to capture many parameters that will ne needed later in this project. We will ask you to save this in a text file as you follow along.

|:information_source: **Information** |
|:---------------------------|
| **The parameter file does not have a special format, it is just a textfile you can store different parameters in that you copy along the way from the portal.**|

## Create a KQL database and KQL Queryset

1. Open the [Microsoft Fabric Webpage](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home)
2. Ensure you are in the real time analytics experience by clicking the experience picker in the lower left corner and selecting Real-Time Analytics

   ![Real time analytics experience](./images/image-001.png)

3. Click the "KQL database" button at the top of the screen

5. On the main page of the KQL Database, note the Query URI with a dedicated button to copy the URI. Click this button and **Save the Query URI AND the Database name to your Param file.**

   ![copy URI](./images/image-004.png)

6. Navigate back to ***My workspace*** using the shortcut to the left of the screen

   ![back to my workspace](./images/image-005.png)

7. Click the **New** dropdown menu to the top left of the screen and select ***KQL Query set*** 

   ![Create KQL Query Set](./images/image-006.png)

   ![Name query set](./images/image-007.png)

9. Select the ***QueenOfTheSkies*** Database and click on **Connect**

   ![Select database](./images/image-008.png)

### Structure your KQL Query set

1. Inside your KQL Queryset, create **two additional tabs** using the ***+*** sign next to the first tab.
   1. Name your first tab ***QoS DDL***
   2. Name your second tab ***QoS Planned***
   3. Name your third tab ***QosDemo control***

      ![Insert KQL Query set](./images/image-009.png)

2. From this repo copy and paste the content of the KQL scripts found in [the repo](./Code/KQL/) to their corresponding tabs in the KQL Queryset

      ![copy content](./images/image-010.png)

### Run the database preparation script

1. Run the code contained in the ***QoS DDL*** script

   ![run code](./images/image-011.png)

2. Ensure all operation are successful

      ![check all operations are successful](./images/image-012.png)

### Ingest the sample file

We now will ingest the full flight path all at once. We do this so we can use the complete dataset to reconstruct the planned flight by surgically removing the section of the flight path we do not want and inferring the *planned* data points. In anticipation of that, please download the [***QueenOfTheSky_ex.csv***](/Data/QueenOfTheSky_ex.csv) file from this repo and save it to your local machine.

1. Navigate back to the ***QueenOfTheSKies*** KQL database.
   1. At the left bottom in the menu click on ***Real-Time Analytics***

      ![click Real-Time Analytics](./images/image-013.png)

   2. Then click on the KQL database ***QueenOfTheSkies***

      ![Select database QueenOfTheSkies](./images/image-014.png)

2. Click on the down chevron next to the ***Get Data*** button and select ***Local file***

   ![Click Get Data / local file](./images/image-015.png)

   ![click close](./images/image-021.png)

### Rehydrate the planned flight table

1. Click on ***Real-Time Analytics*** in the bottom left menu.

   ![click on Real-Time Analytics](./images/image-022.png)

3. Navigate to the ***QoS Planned*** tab

   ![Navigate to QoS Planned tab](./images/image-024.png)

4. Run the code and it should display a set of table statistics showing you have indeed ingested data in the ***QueenOfTheSkyPlanned*** table

   ![run query](./images/image-025.png)

### Prepare for the first run

The next steps will create the lakehouse where we will host the sample file and create the artefacts we need to simulate the stream

   ![insert connection string](./images/image-047.png)

4. Next is the ***SampleCsv*** variable that you should populate with the Sample file ABFS path that you captured earlier.

   ![insert abfs path](./images/image-048.png)

### Run the notebook and confirm the data is streaming

We will now be ready to run the notebook and stream the data to event stream. You may remember that we created a source but no destination. The reason is simple, we have no data in the pipe yet and the KQL db destination of event stream has to see some of it to allow its creation. So we will stream it now but let's remember that this will be an incomplete stream and we'll have to do it all again later.

1. Click ***Run all*** at the top.

   ![click on run all](./images/image-049.png)

2. Allow for the spark session to spin up and watch for logs at the bottom that will indicate that the stream has started. you should be seeing messages like this:

```code
*This was batch #:136
We loaded rows from: 1620 to row: 1632
Rows remaining in the stream: 134*
```

### Create a KQL database destination

1. With the stream active, navigate back to your ***QoS_ES*** Event Stream.

   ![navigate back to event stream](./images/image-050.png)

2. Click the ***New Destination*** button and select ***KQL Database***

   ![New Destination](./images/image-050.png)

3. Select ***Direct Ingestion***

   ![Direct Ingestion](./images/image-052.png)

4. Name your destination ***QoS_KQLDb_Dest***

   ![Name your destination](./images/image-053.png)

5. Select the workspace you are working in. In our example it is `Queen of the Sky`.

   ![Select the workspace](./images/image-054.png)

6. Select the ***QueenOfTheSkies*** KQL database and hit ***Add and Configure***

   ![Add and Configure Database](./images/image-055.png)

#### Complete the data mapping

Now you must complete the data mapping.

1. Click the ***QueenOfTheSky*** table.

   ![Click QoS Table](./images/image-056.png)

2. Leave the connection name as is or choose your own and hit ***Next***

   ![Click Next](./images/image-057.png)

3. On the next screen immediatly switch the format to ***JSON*** and hit the button ***Advanced***

   ![choose JSON and click Advances](./images/image-058.png)

4. Select ***Existing mapping*** and choose the ***QueenOfTheSky_mapping*** element in the drop down.

   ![Choose Mapping](./images/image-059.png)

5. Click ***Finish***

   ![Finish](./images/image-060.png)

**Congratulation!** you are now able to stream any CSV file to a KQL database!

## Build the Power BI report

1. Download the Power BI template document (.PBIT) from the repo here and ***Save it to your local drive***. If you cloned the Git Hub Repository you will find the Power BI Report in folder `Code/PBI`.

2. Open the PBIT file and wait for it to prompt you for the parameters

3. It should prompt you for two parameters
   1. ***MyQueryUri*** is the URI of your KQL db that you saved in your param file.
   2. ***MyDatabaseName*** is the name you chose originally for the database.

14 Click ***Load*** and allow the report to connect and load data

   ![click on load](./images/image-061.png)

4.It may require you to sign in to authenticate if not done already

   ![authenticate](./images/image-062.png)

5.***Publish the report*** to your workspace

   ![publish the report](./images/image-063.png)

   ![Navigate back to query set](./images/image-064.png)

2. Run the Clear table command to clean up the landing table

   ![clear table](./images/image-065.png)

3. Run the ***Pre flight query** (see below)

4. The result should be a *All set! Clear for takeoff* message

   ![Result is OK](./images/image-066.png)

1. Navigate back to the ***QueenOfTheSkies_Notebook***

   ![Open Notebook](./images/image-067.png)

2. Click ***Run all***

   ![click on run all](./images/image-068.png)

3. Wait for the Logs at the bottom to show data streaming

   ![wait for logs](./images/image-069.png)

### Run the report

1. Navigate to the ***QueenOfTheSky_rpt*** power BI report

   ![Open PowerBI Report](./images/image-070.png)

2. To set the tone, read the text from the landing page

3. Then navigate to the second page to see the flight path. Note that until you start refreshing the path will not change. Don't wait too long or else the punchline will be spoiled
